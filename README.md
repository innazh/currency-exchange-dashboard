# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## To run:
You can open two terminal windows and run npm run dev in one to start the front end, and npm run api in the other to start the back end.

Optional Features – Not Required
• Implement functionality to save API call data to a database for future use. So, an
API call is not required to use the Frankfurter API each time.
• Setup a function– this doesn’t have to be functional but in theory would run on the
first of each month and add the new exchange rate data for the previous month.
• Any additional features or improvements you believe would enhance the dashboard
functionality or user experience.
